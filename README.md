# Enluarada

A collection of Lua scripts for Kakoune

This repository contains many small scripts created using the [luar](https://github.com/gustavo-hms/luar) plugin for [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/). Since individually they don't make a full-fledged plugin, they are put together here. Despite their simplicity, they are useful after all.

Since these scripts are heterogeneous, providing solutions for different tasks, it can happen that you are only interested in a subset of them. Thus, each group of scripts is wrapped inside its own module. This way you can load only those useful for you. See the README on each subdirectory for more details.
