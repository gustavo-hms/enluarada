# Enluarada

A collection of Lua scripts for Kakoune

This repository contains many small scripts created using the [luar](https://github.com/gustavo-hms/luar) plugin for [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/). Since individually they don't make a full-fledged plugin, they are put together here, because, despite their simplicity, they are useful after all.
